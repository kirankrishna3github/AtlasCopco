*&  Include           RMMCR_FRSEG_ENH
*&  Dummy carrier applied to AC0 in 2004/08 by KH for IS2ERP OIL project,
*&  but of course also be useable for other ADD-Ons
*&---------------------------------------------------------------------*
* !! Please note that this include is included within an internal
* !! structure definition within type group MMCR. Consider the place
* !! of the include within TYPE and consider the DOT at the end of this
* !! additional ADD-On fields.
* We use this solution, because an DDIC-solution (with add-on appends)
* would need a complete redesign of MMCR type group !!

* This include will only be a dummy carrier to use enhancement-point
* static within ADD-On systems e.g. within IS2ERP project, because
* the normal switch framework architecture does not support a complete
* redefinition of the internal (type group) structure MMCR_FRSEG.
* Additionally the current internal definition have so many dependencies
* to other internal defined types in MMCR, that a DDIC solution might
* be too complex as a basis of a complete redesign.
* With this solution, the core will not have any negative effect, but
* offers the possibility to enhance the internal type definition for
* any ADD-On.

* Note, that this content is part of MMCR-definition
* TYPES: BEGIN OF mmcr_frseg,                "<-- only for info

ENHANCEMENT-POINT RMMCR_FRSEG_ENH_01 SPOTS ES_RMMCR_FRSEG_ENH STATIC INCLUDE BOUND.

ENHANCEMENT-POINT RMMCR_FRSEG_ENH_02 SPOTS ES_RMMCR_FRSEG_ENH STATIC INCLUDE BOUND.


">>>>>> End of additional types >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
* TYPES: END OF mmcr_frseg.                  "<-- only for info

* Example for enhancement (don't forget the "TYPES:" at the beginning
* and the DOT at the end of your enhancement):
"Types: oia_fe like drseg-oia_fe                          "SO4K004264 RD
"      ,oinegpstg like drseg-oinegpstg                    "SO4K004264 MW
"      .            "<- !! Important DOT at the end of enhancement
* Note that this example depends on another enhancment within V54A0
