*&  Include           RMRM_IDOC_DATA_ERS_SBO
*&  Dummy carrier applied to AC0 in 2004/11/02 by JW for IS2ERP SBO
*&  project,
*&  but of course also be useable for other ADD-Ons
*&---------------------------------------------------------------------*
* !! Please note that this include is included within an internal
* !! structure definition within type group MRM. Consider the place
* !! of the include within TYPE and consider the DOT at the end of this
* !! additional ADD-On fields.
* We use this solution, because an DDIC-solution (with add-on appends)
* would need a complete redesign of MRM type group !!

* This include will only be a dummy carrier to use enhancement-point
* static within ADD-On systems e.g. within IS2ERP project, because
* the normal switch framework architecture does not support a complete
* redefinition of the internal (type group) structure
* MRM_IDOC_DATA_ERS_SBO.
* Additionally the current internal definition have so many dependencies
* to other internal defined types in MRM, that a DDIC solution might
* be too complex as a basis of a complete redesign.
* With this solution, the core will not have any negative effect, but
* offers the possibility to enhance the internal type definition for
* any ADD-On.

* Note, that this content is part of MRM-definition
